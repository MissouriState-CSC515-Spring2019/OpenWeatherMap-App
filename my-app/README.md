OpenWeatherApi App

Overview
This single page React app is using the OpenWeather Api to grab data and display it in three different views. This application will by default load Springfield Missouri's weather. To change location just type a valid zipcode into the search bar located in the navbar. This application works for zipcodes only inside of the US. 

*API can't handle more than 60 calls per minute! Please email dwc678@live.missouristate.edu if this is exceeded.*
